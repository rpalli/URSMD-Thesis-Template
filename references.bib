abstract = {WikiPathways (wikipathways.org) captures the collective knowledge represented in biological pathways. By providing a database in a curated, machine readable way, omics data analysis and visualization is enabled. WikiPathways and other pathway databases are used to analyze experimental data by research groups in many fields. Due to the open and collaborative nature of the WikiPathways platform, our content keeps growing and is getting more accurate, making WikiPathways a reliable and rich pathway database. Previously, however, the focus was primarily on genes and proteins, leaving many metabolites with only limited annotation. Recent curation efforts focused on improving the annotation of metabolism and metabolic pathways by associating unmapped metabolites with database identifiers and providing more detailed interaction knowledge. Here, we report the outcomes of the continued growth and curation efforts, such as a doubling of the number of annotated metabolite nodes in WikiPathways. Furthermore, we introduce an OpenAPI documentation of our web services and the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) annotation of resources to increase the interoperability of the knowledge encoded in these pathways and experimental omics data. New search options, monthly downloads, more links to metabolite databases, and new portals make pathway knowledge more effortlessly accessible to individual researchers and research communities.},

abstract = {HVTN 505 is a preventative vaccine efficacy trial testing DNA followed by recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) in circumcised, Ad5-seronegative men and transgendered persons who have sex with men in the United States. Identified immune correlates of lower HIV-1 risk and a virus sieve analysis revealed that, despite lacking overall efficacy, vaccine-elicited responses exerted pressure on infecting HIV-1 viruses. To interrogate the mechanism of the antibody correlate of HIV-1 risk, we examined antigen-specific antibody recruitment of Fc$\gamma$ receptors (Fc$\gamma$Rs), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and the role of anti-envelope (anti-Env) IgG3. In a prespecified immune correlates analysis, antibody-dependent monocyte phagocytosis and antibody binding to Fc$\gamma$RIIa correlated with decreased HIV-1 risk. Follow-up analyses revealed that anti-Env IgG3 breadth correlated with reduced HIV-1 risk, anti-Env IgA negatively modified infection risk by Fc effector functions, and that vaccine recipients with a specific Fc$\gamma$RIIa single-nucleotide polymorphism locus had a stronger correlation with decreased HIV-1 risk when ADCP, Env-Fc$\gamma$RIIa, and IgG3 binding were high. Additionally, Fc$\gamma$RIIa engagement correlated with decreased viral load setpoint in vaccine recipients who acquired HIV-1. These data support a role for vaccine-elicited anti-HIV-1 Env IgG3, antibody engagement of FcRs, and phagocytosis as potential mechanisms for HIV-1 prevention.},

abstract = {Human antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) triggered by immunization are globally recognized as CD19loCD38hiCD27hi. Yet, different vaccines give rise to antibody responses of different longevity, suggesting ASC populations are heterogeneous. We define circulating-ASC heterogeneity in vaccine responses using multicolor flow cytometry, morphology, VH repertoire, and RNA transcriptome analysis. We also tested differential survival using a human cell-free system that mimics the bone marrow (BM) microniche. In peripheral blood, we identified 3 CD19+ and 2 CD19- ASC subsets. All subsets contributed to the vaccine-specific responses and were characterized by in vivo proliferation and activation. The VH repertoire demonstrated strong oligoclonality with extensive interconnectivity among the 5 subsets and switched memory B cells. Transcriptome analysis showed separation of CD19+ and CD19- subsets that included pathways such as cell cycle, hypoxia, TNF-$\alpha$, and unfolded protein response. They also demonstrated similar long-term in vitro survival after 48 days. In summary, vaccine-induced ASCs with different surface markers (CD19 and CD138) are derived from shared proliferative precursors yet express distinctive transcriptomes. Equal survival indicates that all ASC compartments are endowed with long-lived potential. Accordingly, in vivo survival of peripheral long-lived plasma cells may be determined in part by their homing and residence in the BM microniche.},

abstract = {Antibodies are the primary correlate of protection for most licensed vaccines; however, their mechanisms of protection may vary, ranging from physical blockade to clearance via the recruitment of innate immunity. Here, we uncover striking functional diversity in vaccine-induced antibodies that is driven by immunization site and is associated with reduced risk of SIV infection in nonhuman primates. While equivalent levels of protection were observed following intramuscular (IM) and aerosol (AE) immunization with an otherwise identical DNA primeâ€“Ad5 boost regimen, reduced risk of infection was associated with IgG-driven antibody-dependent monocyte-mediated phagocytosis in the IM vaccinees, but with vaccine-elicited IgA-driven neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis in AE-immunized animals. Thus, although route-independent correlates indicate a critical role for phagocytic Fc-effector activity in protection from SIV, the site of immunization may drive this Fc activity via distinct innate effector cells and antibody isotypes. Moreover, the same correlates predicted protection from SHIV infection in a second nonhuman primate vaccine trial using a disparate IM canarypox primeâ€“protein boost strategy, analogous to that used in the first moderately protective human HIV vaccine trial. These data identify orthogonal functional humoral mechanisms, initiated by distinct vaccination routes and immunization strategies, pointing to multiple, potentially complementary correlates of immunity that may support the rational design of a protective vaccine against HIV.},

Although the majority of these proteins repress B cell receptor-mediated activation, there is an emerging evidence for their bifunctionality and capacity to counter-regulate adaptive and innate signaling pathways. In light of these findings, the recent discovery of ligands for several of these molecules has begun to reveal exciting potential for them in normal lymphocyte biology and is launching a new phase of FCRL investigation. Importantly, these fundamental developments are also setting the stage for defining their altered roles in the pathogenesis of a growing number of immune-mediated diseases.

abstract = {Hypergammaglobulinemia and defective humoral immunity are hallmarks of HIV-1 infection. Naive B cells have been recently suggested as the major source of hypergammaglobulinemia in chronic viral infections. We recently reported that HIV-1-infected patients carry low levels of memory B cells. Here we studied whether defects in the naive and memory B cells in HIV-1-infected patients translated into hypergammaglobulinemia and defective humoral immunity against specific antigens. Naive B cells from HIV-1-infected patients exhibited abnormal expression of the activation/differentiation markers CD70 and leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor (LAIR-1). Activated naive B cells from patients showed a significant increase in the intracellular immunoglobulin G (IgG) content ex vivo and this activated phenotype correlated to hypergammaglobulinemia and to the ability of naive B cells from patients to secrete IgG in vitro. We analyzed the levels of antibodies to tetanus toxold, measles, and HIV-1 in relation to memory B cells and observed a significant reduction of antigen-specific antibodies in patients with low-memory B lymphocytes. Nevertheless, hypergammaglobulinemia and levels of polyspecific self-reactive antibodies were comparable in patients with normal and low memory B cells. We conclude that reduction of memory B lymphocytes in HIV-1 infection correlates with defective humoral immunity and that hyperactivated naive B cells may represent the source of abnormal IgG production in HIV-1 infection. Our results may be relevant to the design of HIV-1 therapeutical vaccines and to the clinical management of HIV-1-infected patients. {\textcopyright} 2004 by The American Society of Hematology.},

The HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 binds to and signals through integrin $\alpha$ 4 $\beta$ 7 on T cells. We found that gp120 also bound to and signaled through $\alpha$ 4 $\beta$ 7 on naive B cells, which resulted in an abortive proliferative response. In primary B cells, signaling by gp120 through $\alpha$ 4 $\beta$ 7 resulted in increased expression of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-$\beta$1 and FcRL4, an inhibitory receptor expressed on B cells. Coculture of B cells with HIV-1-infected autologous CD4 + T cells also increased the expression of FcRL4 by B cells. Our findings indicated that in addition to mediating chronic activation of the immune system, viral proteins contributed directly to HIV-1-associated B cell dysfunction.

abstract = {We studied B-lymphocyte function in 12 homosexual male patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 5 healthy homosexual men, and 12 heterosexual controls. In comparison with the heterosexual controls, the patients were found to have elevated numbers of cells spontaneously secreting immunoglobulin, decreased B-cell proliferative responses to T-cellâ€“independent B-cell mitogens, and qualitatively deficient helper T cells. The hyperactive spontaneous B-cell responses as well as the refractoriness to signals for T-cellâ€”independent B-cell activation were highly suggestive of an in vivo polyclonal activation of B cells and may have been responsible for the manifestations of B-cell hyperreactivity, such as hypergammaglobulinemia, seen in these patients. We conclude that the scope of immune dysfunction in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome involves B cells as well as T cells. (N Engl J Med 1983; 309:453â€“8.) OVER the past two years, a new syndrome has been described that consists of severe opportunistic infections; the development of neoplasms, especially Kaposi's sarcoma; and profound abnormalities of cellular immune function in previously healthy persons.1 2 3 4The disease was initially described in the male homosexual community, where it has begun to reach epidemic proportions; however, it has also recently been described in Haitian immigrants, hemophiliacs, and users of intravenous drugs.

abstract = { B cell activation is regulated by the stimulatory or inhibitory co-receptors of B cell receptors (BCRs). Here, we investigated the signaling mechanism of Fc receptor-like 1 (FcRL1), a newly identified BCR co-receptor. FcRL1 was passively recruited into B cell immunological synapses upon BCR engagement in the absence of FcRL1 cross-linking, suggesting that FcRL1 may intrinsically regulate B cell activation and function. BCR cross-linking alone led to the phosphorylation of the intracellular Y 281 ENV motif of FcRL1 to provide a docking site for c-Abl, an SH2 domain-containing kinase. The FcRL1 and c-Abl signaling module, in turn, potently augmented B cell activation and proliferation. FcRL1-deficient mice exhibited markedly impaired formation of extrafollicular plasmablasts and germinal centers, along with decreased antibody production upon antigen stimulation. These findings reveal a critical BCR signal-enhancing function of FcRL1 through its intrinsic recruitment to B cell immunological synapses and subsequent recruitment of c-Abl upon BCR cross-linking. },

abstract = {Innate-like splenic marginal zone (MZ) and peritoneal cavity B1 B lymphocytes share critical responsibilities in humoral responses but have divergent B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling features. A discrete marker of these subsets with tyrosine-based dual regulatory potential termed "Fc receptor-like 5" (FCRL5) was investigated to explore this discrepancy. Although FCRL5 repressed the robust BCR activity that is characteristic of MZ B cells, it had no influence on antigen receptor stimulation that is blunted in peritoneal cavityderived B1 B cells. The molecular basis for the receptor's inhibitory function derived from recruitment of the Src homology-2 domaincontaining tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) to a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. Surprisingly, mutagenesis of this docking site unearthed coactivation properties for FCRL5 that were orchestrated by independent association of the Lyn Src-family kinase with an intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine- based activation motif-like sequence. FCRL5's unique binary regulation directly correlated with SHP-1 and Lyn activity, which, like BCR function, differed between MZ and B1 B cells. These findings collectively imply a specialized counterregulatory role for FCRL molecules at the intersection of innate and adaptive immunity.},
